h3 Bridge to Education
p.
	Providing education to the poor is a complex proposition. However, many educationists believe that one of the major reasons for the early dropout of poor children is untrained teachers. 
p.
	Elementary school teachers who serve the poor in the developing countries may have as much love, caring and dedication as any other teacher in the world. However, they are the least trained, work with practically no teaching tools and hold one of the lowest paid jobs in their countries.

	We believe that Information Technology can and should be used to provide the best of training to the elementary school teachers who serve the poor. Suddenly, a very complex and major problem is solvable. 
	
p.
	Towards this end, Books for Life, the educational branch of Trees for Life, is building a Bridge to Education. This bridge will allow qualified, trained teachers to share their skills and knowledge with teachers who need such training.
